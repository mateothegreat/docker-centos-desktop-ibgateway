# If ForceTwsApiPort is set to an integer, it forces IBController to
# change the TWS API Socket Port to that number shortly after
# startup. This setting is most commonly required if you are running
# multiple IBController instances for different accounts and would
# like different ports to be configured automatically (ie without you
# needing do this manually in the TWS window that IBController would
# open). Leaving the setting blank will make no change, so 4001 or
# 7496 would be the usual default (or whatever you manually change
# the port number to).

ForceTwsApiPort=CONF_API_PORT


# If ReadOnlyLogin is set to 'yes', and the user is enrolled in IB's
# account security programme, the user will not be asked to supply
# the security code, and login to TWS will occur automatically in
# read-only mode: in this mode, placing or managing orders is not
# allowed. If set to 'no', and the user is enrolled in IB's account
# security programme, the user must supply the relevant security
# code to complete the login. If the user is not enrolled in IB's
# account security programme, this setting is ignored. The default
# is 'no'.

ReadOnlyLogin=CONF_IB_READ_ONLY


# Logging in to a paper-trading account results in TWS displaying
# a dialog asking the user to confirm that they are aware that this
# is not a brokerage account. Until this dialog has been accepted,
# TWS will not allow API connections to succeed. Setting this
# to 'yes' (the default) will cause IBController to automatically
# confirm acceptance. Setting it to 'no' will leave the dialog
# on display, and the user will have to deal with it manually.

AcceptNonBrokerageAccountWarning=yes


# 4.   TWS Auto-Closedown
# -----------------------
#
# Set to yes or no (lower case):
#
#   yes   means allow TWS to shut down automatically at its
# 	  specified shutdown time, which is set via the TWS
#	  configuration menu.
#
#   no    means TWS never shuts down automatically.
#
# NB: IB recommends that you do not keep TWS running
# continuously. If you set this setting to 'no', you may
# experience incorrect TWS operation.

IbAutoClosedown=no



# 5.   TWS Tidy Closedown Time
# ----------------------------
#
# To tell IBController to tidily close TWS at a
# specified day of the week and time, set this value
# to <dayOfWeek hh:mm>
# for example:
# ClosedownAt=Friday 22:00
#
# Note that the day of the week must be specified using your
# default locale. Also note that Java will only accept
# characters encoded to ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1). This means that
# if the day name in your default locale uses any non-Latin-1
# characters you need to encode them using Unicode escapes
# (see http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/lexical.html#3.3
# for details). For example, to tidily close TWS at 12:00 on
# Saturday where the default locale is Simplified Chinese,
# use the following:
# #ClosedownAt=\u661F\u671F\u516D 12:00

ClosedownAt=



# 6.   Other TWS Settings
# -----------------------
#
# If you attempt to place an order for a contract for which
# you have no market data subscription, TWS displays a dialog
# to warn you against such blind trading.
#
#   yes   means the dialog is dismissed as though the user had
# 	  clicked the 'Ok' button: this means that you accept
# 	  the risk and want the order to be submitted.
#
#   no    means the dialog remains on display and must be
#         handled by the user.

AllowBlindTrading=no


# Indian versions of TWS may display a password expiry
# notification dialog and a NSE Compliance dialog. These can be
# dismissed by setting the following to yes. By default the
# password expiry notice is not dismissed, but the NSE Compliance
# notice is dismissed.

# Warning: setting DismissPasswordExpiryWarning=yes will mean
# you will not be notified when your password is about to expire.
# You must then take other measures to ensure that your password
# is changed within the expiry period, otherwise IBController will
# not be able to login successfully.

DismissPasswordExpiryWarning=no
DismissNSEComplianceNotice=yes


# Since TWS 906, orders placed using the BookTrader have to be confirmed
# via a dialog box (this was due to a legal dispute between IB and Trading
# Technologies who claimed IB were infringing a patent). If
# AutoConfirmOrders=yes, then when orders are placed using the BookTrader,
# the confirmation dialog is automatically handled, thereby effectively
# restoring the one-click trading. The default is 'no', requiring the user
# to manually confirm each trade.
#
# NB: this setting has been removed as the dispute has been resolved and
# TWS users now have the option to request the order confirmation dialog
# to not be displayed.
#
#AutoConfirmOrders=no


# You can tell TWS to automatically save its settings on a schedule
# of your choosing. You can specify one of more specific times,
# like this:
#
# SaveTwsSettingsAt=HH;MM [ HH:MM]...
#
# for example:
# SaveTwsSettingsAt=08:00   12:30 17:30
#
# Or you can specify an interval at which settings are to be saved,
# optionally starting at a specific time and continuing until another
# time, like this:
#
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every n [{mins | hours}] [hh:mm] [hh:mm]
#
# where the first hh:mm is the shart time and the second is the end
# time. If you don't specify the end time, settings are saved regularly
# from the start time till midnight. If you don't specify the start time.
# settings are saved reularly all day, beginning at 00:00. Note that
# settings will always be saved at the end time, even if that is not
# exactly one interval later than the previous time. Examples:
#
# To save every 30 minutes all day starting at 00:00
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 30
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 30 mins
#
# To save every hour starting at 08:00 and ending at midnight
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 1 hours 08:00
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 1 hours 08:00 00:00
#
# To save every 90 minutes starting at 08:00 up to and including 17:43
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 90 08:00 17:43

SaveTwsSettingsAt=



# 6.   IBController Server Settings
# ---------------------------------
#
# Do NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING SETTINGS unless you
# intend to issue commands to IBController (for example
# using telnet). Note that these settings have nothing to
# do with running programs that use the TWS API.

# The port that IBController listens on for commands
# such as "STOP". DO NOT set this to the port number
# used for TWS API connections. There is no good reason
# to change this setting unless the port is used by
# some other application.

IbControllerPort=CONF_CONTROLLER_PORT


# A comma separated list of ip addresses, or host names,
# which are allowed addresses for sending commands to
# IBController.  Commands can always be sent from the
# same host as IBController is running on.

IbControlFrom=


# Specifies the IP address on which the IBController Server
# is to listen. For a multi-homed host, this can be used
# to specify that connection requests are only to be
# accepted on the specified address. The default is to
# accept connection requests on all local addresses.

IbBindAddress=


# The specified string is output by the server when
# the connection is first opened and after the completion
# of each command. This can be useful if sending commands
# using an interactive program such as telnet. The default
# is that no prompt is output.
# For example:
#
# CommandPrompt=>

CommandPrompt=


# Some commands can return intermediate information about
# their progress. This setting controls whether such
# information is sent. The default is that such information
# is not sent.

SuppressInfoMessages=no



# 7.   Diagnostic Settings
# ------------------------

# If LogComponents is set to 'open' or 'yes' or 'true',
# IBController logs information about the structure of each
# TWS window it detects the first time it is encountered. If
# set to 'activate', the information is logged every time
# a TWS window is made active. If set to 'never' or 'no' or
# 'false', this information is never logged. The default is
# 'never'.
#
# The logged information shows the hierarchical organisation
# of all the components of the window, and includes the
# current values of text boxes and labels.
#
# Note that when set to 'open', 'activate' or'yes', there is
# a small performance impact due to the extra logging. Also
# logfile size may be significantly increased, especially if
# set to 'activate' and the user is actively using TWS. It
# is therefore recommended that the setting be left at 'no'
# unless there is a specific reason that this information is
# needed.

LogComponents=never
